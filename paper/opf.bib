	abstract = 	 {Motivated by the increasing complexity in the control of distribution level electric power systems especially in a smart grid environment, we propose fully decentralized algorithms to solve alternating current (AC) optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The key feature of the proposed algorithms is a complete decentralization of computation down to nodal level. In this way, no central or sub-area controller is needed, and the OPF problem is solved by individual nodes, which only have local knowledge of the system. Preliminary results show promising performance of the fully decentralized algorithms.},

	abstract={We explore machine learning methods for AC Optimal Powerflow (ACOPF) the task of optimizing power generation in a transmission network according while respecting physical and engineering constraints. We present two formulations of ACOPF as a machine learning problem: 1) an endto-end prediction task where we directly predict the optimal generator settings, and 2) a constraint prediction task where we predict the set of active constraints in the optimal solution. We validate these approaches on two benchmark grids.}

	title={History of Optimal Power Flow and Formulations},
	pages={1-31},
	abstract={The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and propose areas where the ACOPF could be improved.  The ACOPF is at the heart of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets, and is solved in some form every year for system planning, every day for day-ahead markets, every hour, and even every 5 minutes. It was first formulated in 1962, and formulations have changed little over the years. With advances in computing power and solution algorithms, we can model more of the constraints and remove unnecessary limits and approximations that were previously required to find a solution in reasonable time. One example is nonlinear voltage magnitude constraints that are modeled as linear thermal proxy constraints. In this paper, we refer to the full ACOPF as an ACOPF that simultaneously optimizes real and reactive power. Today, 50 years after the problem was formulated, we still do not have a fast, robust solution technique for the full ACOPF.  Finding a good solution technique for the full ACOPF could potentially save tens of billions of dollars annually. Based on our literature review, we find that the ACOPF research community lacks a common understanding of the problem, its formulation, and objective functions. However, we do not claim that this literature review is a complete reviewâ€”our intent was simply to capture the major formulations of the ACOPF. Instead, in this paper, we seek to clearly present the ACOPF problem through clear formulations of the problem and its parameters. This paper defines and discusses the polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage formulations of the ACOPF. Additionally, it discusses the different types of constraints and objective functions. T his paper lays the groundwork for further research on the convexapproximation of the ACOPF solution space, a survey of solution techniques, and computational performance of different formulations. },

A number of functional operating constraints, such as branch flow limits, load bus voltage magnitude limits, and generator reactive capabilities, are included as penalties in the GA fitness function (FF). Advanced and problem-specific operators are introduced in order to enhance the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy.

	abstract={This paper presents a new power flow method tailored for genetic algorithms application in solving optimal power flow problems. Generating units, the only controllable elements for which four variables are associated, were given special attention, since they influence to great extent both speed and robustness of any power flow method. In this paper, the standard procedure in which one sets the generator-bus active power output and voltage magnitude has been replaced by an innovative approach where generator-bus voltage magnitude and voltage angle are scheduled. The method relies on the bus admittance matrix, which due to applied bus ordering in layers has block tridiagonal sparse structure. A new technique for Gaussian elimination and back-substitution for such matrices has been developed. The results from five test systems have shown superiority in both time and robustness of the proposed method over the well-known fast decoupled power flow method.},

	title={Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Approach for Solving the Discrete OPF Problem Considering the Valve Loading Effects},
	year={2007},
	volume={22},
	number={4},
	pages={2030-2038},
	abstract={This paper presents a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm (HPSO) as a modern optimization tool to solve the discrete optimal power flow (OPF) problem that has both discrete and continuous optimization variables. The problem is classified as constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming with multimodal characteristics. The objective functions considered are the system real power losses, fuel cost, and the gaseous emissions of the generating units. Two different types of fuel cost functions are considered in this study, namely the conventional quadratic function and the augmented quadratic function to introduce more accurate modeling that incorporates the valve loading effects. The latter model presents nondifferentiable and nonconvex regions that challenge most gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm makes use of the PSO, known for its global searching capabilities, to allocate the optimal control settings while Newton-Raphson algorithm minimizes the mismatch of the power flow equations. A hybrid inequality constraint handling mechanism that preserves only feasible solutions without the need to augment the original objective function is incorporated in the proposed approach. To demonstrate its robustness, the proposed algorithm was tested on the IEEE 30-bus system with six generating units. Several cases were investigated to test and validate the consistency of detecting optimal or near optimal solution for each objective. Results are compared to solutions obtained of MATPOWER software outcomes that employs sequential quadratic programming algorithm to solve the OPF. The impact of the proposed inequality constraint handling method in improving the HPSO performance is illustrated. Furthermore, a study of HPSO parameters tuning with regard to the OPF problem is presented and analyzed.},
